# LanSAR
Language-commanded Scene-aware Action Response is a transformer architecture for producing motion based on multimodal contextual information, such as spatial and visual data, conditioned on a language command.
This went through well over a year of research with countless iterations of the training routine and model architecture. There is a lot of messy, poorly structured, and leftover code throughout this entire project. It was cleaned up considerably for the first public commit, but needs additional refactoring.
